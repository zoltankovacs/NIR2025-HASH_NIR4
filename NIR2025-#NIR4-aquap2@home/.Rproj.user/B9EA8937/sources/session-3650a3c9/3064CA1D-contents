# prepare experiment ----

# create a home folder for each experiment
# there, in this folder created above, create an R-Studio project
# from within this R-Studio project, launch the aquap2 package
library(aquap2)

# create the necessary folder structure
genFolderStr()

# provide the required information in the metadata file. (metadata/metadata.r)

# aquap2 can help in creating a randomized sample list that can be used during 
#data acquisition
exportSampleList()

# data acquisition ----
# 1) use the sample list created above (or your own sample list) when recording the 
# spectra
# 2) after data acquisition, move the rawdata file containing the spectra and a 
# possible logger file containing e.g. temperature data into the "rawdata" folder
# 3) Rename the file containing the spectra to the experiment name as given in
# the metadata (see ?gfd for further information)



# Data Evalutaion ----
# we assume that we already did our experiment, and we already have the acquired 
# spectra copied into the folder "rawdata" and renamed

# import raw spectra and data from the temperature and humidity data logger
fd <- gfd(slType = "csv", trhLog = "ESPEC")
# now the complete dataset is saved in the folder "R-data" 

# we can look at the dataset:
fd
str(fd, max.level = 3)
str(fd, max.level = 4)

# plot the spectra
plot(fd, pg.where="")

# now we focus on the first overtone only
fdCut <- selectWls(fd, 1300, 1600)
plot(fdCut, pg.where="")

# use the function "gdmm" to produce the so called "cube", an object containing
# datasets and models according the the analysis procedure

cube <- gdmm(fd, ap=getap("ap1.r"))
cube
str(cube, max.level = 4)
